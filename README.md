# Small C Projects

A collection of beginner C projects built while learning the fundamentals of programming in C.

## Purpose

This repository contains small projects that helped me practice core C concepts like file I/O, control flow, memory management, and user input handling. Each project focuses on building something functional while reinforcing specific programming concepts.

## Projects
### 1. Number Guessing Game
A simple guessing game where the computer picks a random number and you try to guess it.

**Features:**
- Random number generation (1-100)
- Feedback on each guess (too high/too low)
- Tracks number of attempts
- *(Leaderboard coming soon)*

**Concepts practiced:**
- Random number generation
- Loops and conditionals
- Input validation
- Basic game logic

**How to run:**
```bash
gcc guessing_game.c -o guessing_game
./guessing_game
```

## Learning Goals

- Master C syntax and fundamentals
- Understand memory management
- Practice file operations
- Build problem-solving skills
- Write clean, readable code



## Notes

These projects are simple by design. The focus is on learning core concepts correctly rather than building complex applications. Code may not be optimized or follow advanced patterns—that's intentional as I'm still building foundations.

## Requirements

- GCC compiler
- Linux/Unix environment (or WSL on Windows)
- Basic terminal knowledge

## Compilation

All projects can be compiled with:
```bash
gcc filename.c -o outputname
```

No external libraries required (only standard C library).
